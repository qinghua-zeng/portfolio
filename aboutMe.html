                        <p>
                            I am Qinghua and I am a 28 year old Chinese man, here in beautiful New Zealand on a working
                            holiday
                            visa. I
                            am looking for a UI/UX/UE relating job.

                            I have lots of experience in many working fields related to design, although I am a trained
                            industrial
                            designer. I would say I am a jack of all trades including graphic
                            design(Illustrator/Photoshop), UI
                            design
                            (Axure), user research, 3D modeling (Rhino/Grasshopper/Alias)… the list goes on and on. But
                            simultaneously I
                            also know how to code (c++). As mentioned, I have a broad diversified skillset.

                            I have working experiences in design studios and also in Philips, a world top 500 company. I
                            am a
                            quick
                            learner who is reliable and loves to gain new skills. As a hard working person, I don’t mind
                            long
                            hours
                            or
                            weekend/night shifts.

                            For the right offer I would definitely commit to stay long term, of course if we both sense
                            that we
                            are
                            a
                            good match. But also don’t shy away if your offer is only short term. I am flexible.

                            I am confident I will make an immediate positive contribution to your company.

                        Qinghua Zeng has worked as an intern in Mathis Heller studio of Industrial & Automobile Design
                        during
                        March
                        to July 2015. At that time, as a senior designer of the studio, I was mainly responsible for the
                        design
                        project of the studio, and also responsible for the management of the intern work.
                        I experienced him as a very creative and self-motivated intern, proficient in sketching skills
                        and also
                        has
                        a good sense of style. Until now, his internship works have been displayed in the studio.
                        During his time in the studio he showed and further developed his design skills and
                        communication skills
                        in
                        English. As a very quick learner he was also develop the software capabilities in a very short
                        time.
                        I can very much recommend Qinghua Zeng with full confidence. Although now I have left Heller
                        Studio,
                        please
                        fell free let me know if you need any information about him.

                        I am delighted to write this reference letter for Qinghua Zeng, a brilliant employee of mine. I
                        have
                        known
                        Qinghua Zeng since May 2016 as his line manager in Philips.

                        Qinghua Zeng worked as a usability engineer at my department from July 2016 to March 2018. He
                        was
                        extremely
                        hardworking and dedicated from very beginning and was always ready to learn more each day. He
                        processed
                        excellent design knowledges, communication skills and organization abilities.

                        This work included user experience research and design to make our CT products to be safer and
                        easier to
                        use
                        for our customers and compliance with FDA/IEC regulations. He learnt very quickly on how to
                        handle these
                        and
                        completed all his tasks to our satisfaction.
